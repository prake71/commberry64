Commberry64 - Revive the Commodore 64
======================================

Commberry64 is a tribute to the Commodore 64 home computer from the 1980s.
Technically Commberry64 is a Linux distribution for the Raspberry Pi single board computer which 
boots directly into a C64 emulation mode.

Commberrry64 is intentionally based on the official Raspian distribution from the Raspberry Pi 
Foundation.

This repository primarily hosts the custom scripts used to manage several services
offered within the Commberry64 distribution.
There are scripts for starting the emulator, resetting or shutdown the raspberry or detecting
an usb stick and copy its content to the SD-card.

You can find the homepage of the Commberry64 project under http://commberry64.org/.
